# PulseDraft

Controlled Human Rhythm for AI-Generated Text

PulseDraft is a modular transformation framework designed to reduce detectable AI uniformity in generated content while preserving factual accuracy, structural clarity, and semantic intent.

It introduces calibrated human rhythm into AI drafts.

Not randomness.  
Not gimmicks.  
Not evasion.

Controlled variance.

## Why PulseDraft Exists

Modern AI systems generate text that is:

- Structurally symmetrical  
- Tonally uniform  
- Transition-heavy  
- Predictably rhythmic  
- Lexically safe  

As AI content scales globally, statistical similarity increases. Many ranking systems and content evaluators rely on pattern clustering rather than explicit AI detection.

PulseDraft addresses this by engineering measured irregularity across specific entropy dimensions.

The goal is signal differentiation — not manipulation.

## Core Principles

PulseDraft operates under strict constraints:

1. Preserve factual meaning  
2. Preserve SEO and structural intent  
3. Avoid artificial grammar errors  
4. Avoid chaotic randomness  
5. Output only improved text  

This is controlled irregularity.

Human rhythm without loss of clarity.

## What PulseDraft Does

PulseDraft transforms AI-generated drafts by adjusting:

- Lexical diversity  
- Sentence-length volatility (burstiness)  
- Transition predictability  
- Formatting symmetry  
- Emotional micro-variance  
- Cliché density  
- Passive voice saturation  
- Perplexity volatility  

All while maintaining coherence.

## What It Does NOT Do (Ideally)

- It does not fabricate data  
- It does not inject slang artificially  
- It does not change meaning  
- It does not insert fake specificity  
- It does not degrade readability  

PulseDraft is structural, not cosmetic.
